<p>That's right there's none. In fact if your still reading this I might as well just start a one sided conversation and write about the amazing (long) books I've read. Of of the best books i've read would have to be Ready Player One by Earnest Cline. This is because it combines the immmersive aspect of video games to a distopian world where the only escape is the virtul reality of OASIS. However if it included the real world problems that would arise from the world wide extermination of cats to help mke further develope my plans of world wide dom.... you know what never mind, it's good as it is. Book two would have to the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay as it's a suprisingly good venture of the people known as kaviliar and clay and how they grow up to be successful making comics.It's great(long) and that's why I picked it up and thats why i'm reccomening it but i must reccomend that with that i ask that you go out there into the world and kill a cat. Mostly because they are horrible and kill thousands of birds every year. Book 3 the sublte art of not giving a fuck as it's really good.</p>
